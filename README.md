# bb-spotify

Simple scripts to control your music from the command line

## Instructions

- Since this is a non-commercial app, I can't help but ask y'all to register a
  client app on Spotify Dev [Link](https://developer.spotify.com/).

- Set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` that you obtain as `env` variables.

- Make sure you have [bb](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) installed.
